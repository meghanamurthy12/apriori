# Apriori - Frequent Item Set Matching

Apriori is an algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning. A good explanation of Apriori, association rules, support and confidence can be found [here](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/beginners-tutorial-apriori-algorithm-data-mining-r-implementation/). 

Download the Jupyter Notebook and the adult.csv file, and store them in the same directory (or change the path of the filename in the first cell of the notebook) 

The Apriori Algorithm can be "improved" in several ways : hash based technique, transaction reduction, partitioning, sampling and dynamic itemset counting. 
In this notebook, Sampling has been executed in cell [4]. Only run this cell if you wish to perform the Sampling for improving.
